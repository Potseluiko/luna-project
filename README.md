# Luna project (React + Vite)

The project contains only a Sign In form.

You can use the following test data to see how the form works:

- Email: `demo@demo.com` and Password: `demo` → successful sign-in;
- Email: `error@error.com` and Password: `error` → simulates a network error;
- Any other data → displays an error indicating the data is incorrect.

On successful sign-in, a message is logged to the console.
